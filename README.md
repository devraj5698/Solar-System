# Solar-System

A 3d version of our solar system. Includes texture maps of all the stellar objects in our solar system to enhance visuals of the program.
Also provides some basic information on the each of the objects such as mass, size, and distance from the Sun. The movement and sizes of the planets are proportional to the real objects in space, and program offers easy-to-use controls!

It is coded in Python using Pycharm. It uses the visual and PIL library to create the 3d objects and wrap the texture maps on the objects.
